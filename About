ðŸ“„ AI Resume Parser
A simple Streamlit web app that extracts key information from resumes (PDFs) using intelligent parsing and basic natural language techniques.


ðŸ›  Approach
Text Extraction:
Used pdfminer.six to extract raw text from PDFs. It ensures compatibility with text-based PDFs.

Link Extraction:
Used PyMuPDF (fitz) to parse embedded links (e.g., LinkedIn URLs) inside the PDF.

Information Extraction:
Used regular expressions (re) and custom parsing to extract:

Name

Email

Phone Number

LinkedIn Profile

Skills (matches from a predefined list)

Education (degree, institution, year)

Experience (company, title, duration, description)

Projects

ðŸ§° *Libraries/Tools Used*
streamlit for 	Web app interface
pdfminer.six	for Extracting raw text from PDFs
PyMuPDF (fitz) for	Extracting embedded hyperlinks
re (regex) for	Pattern matching for emails, phones, skills, etc.
io for 	Handling file streams

ðŸ“‹ Assumptions & Limitations
Assumptions:

The resume sections are labeled with headings like Education, Experience, Projects, etc.

Skills are matched against a predefined static list.

Names are assumed to be two words in Title Case (e.g., John Doe).

LinkedIn profiles are either found in the text or as embedded links.

Limitations:

Image-based PDFs (scanned resumes) are not supported because no OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is integrated yet.

Unstructured Resumes: Highly unorganized resumes may lead to imperfect extraction.

Certifications Extraction: Currently not implemented. Certifications section returns null.

Skills Detection: If skills are phrased unusually or misspelled, they might not be detected.

Multi-page Complex Resumes: Currently focuses more on simple/medium-complexity resumes.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements (Ideas)
Add OCR support for scanned PDFs using Tesseract.

Train a small ML model for smarter skills and certifications extraction.

Support more dynamic skill extraction beyond a static list.

Improve handling of international date formats.

Detect certifications like AWS, PMP, etc.
